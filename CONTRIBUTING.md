# Contribution Guidelines

## Note: code contributions discouraged in pre-alpha phase

Due to the very early phase of this project, significant changes to code and architecture are still taking place.

Therefore I do not recommend investing time in making code changes until things are more stable.

Contributions in terms of suggestions or other relevant feedback are welcome.

### Commit message format
Ref: [Karma commit message conventions](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
```
type(scope): Message in present tense
```
`type` may be one of:
* **feat** (new feature)
* **fix** (bug fix)
* **docs** (changes to documentation)
* **style** (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
* **refactor** (refactoring production code)
* **test** (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* **chore** (updating build tasks etc; no production code change)

`scope` indicates the package (core, asset-server-plugin, docs etc.)
