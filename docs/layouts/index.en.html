                <h3>De-coupled & Flexible</h3>
                <p>
                    Vendure is a headless framework, meaning that it delivers content through its <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL API</a>, leaving you free to
                    implement your store-front application(s) in the technologies of your choice.
                </p>

                </div>
                <h3>Built for Developers</h3>
                <p>
                    Vendure makes developer productivity a top priority. The framework is written in TypeScript and is
                    built on the npm ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The combination of TypeScript and GraphQL enables end-to-end type safety.

                <h3>Open Source</h3>

                <p>

            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a partial list of some of the features which are planned for the initial release:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Built-in admin interface</strong> Vendure will ship with a fully-functional admin UI app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Full multi-language support</strong> Create and deliver content in any language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guest checkouts</strong> Reduce friction by allowing purchases to be made without requiring
                    a sign-up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fully customizable models</strong> Adding domain-specific properties to your models (products,
                    customers, orders etc.) can be done in just a few lines of configuration code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Faceted search</strong> Facets (e.g. "Brand", "Colour") enable efficient filtering and grouping
                    of products.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Flexible search integrations</strong> Product search is one of the most important aspects of a successful
                    ecommerce experience. Vendure will feature a pluggable interface to allow you to use the search solution
                    of your choice (e.g. Elastic, Algolia etc).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extensible business logic</strong> Need to apply custom shipping logic? Sophisticated promotions?
                    Vendure will feature hooks at each point of the purchase journey which allow you to customise and extend
                    the built-in behaviour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Blazing fast</strong> What feature list would be complete without these two magical words?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who is building Vendure?</h2>
            <p>
                Vendure is being built full-time by <a href="https://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/">Michael Bromley</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been working on custom ecommerce software on and off for the past 13 years. Over that time I've learned
                a lot about how <em>not</em> to do things, and have developed a feel for what I as a developer would
                really like to see in an ecommerce tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also spent the past 3 years working on the core team of the <a href="https://getmesh.io/">Gentics Mesh</a> headless CMS.
                During my time on that project I came to appreciate the power of the API-first approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vendure is the culmination of my years in the trenches of yesterday's ecommerce development combined with
                my passion for front-end development and my conviction that headless architecture - and GraphQL
                in particular - are the way of the future.
