# Deploying a Vendure Application

A Vendure application is essentially a Node.js application, and can be deployed to any environment that supports Node.js.

The bare minimum requirements are:

* A server with Node.js installed
* A database server (if using MySQL/Postgres)

A typical pattern is to run the Vendure app on the server, e.g. at `http://localhost:3000` an then use [nginx as a reverse proxy](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) to direct requests from the Internet to the Vendure application.

Here is a good guide to setting up a production-ready server for an app such as Vendure: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-18-04

## Health/Readiness Checks

If you wish to deploy with Kubernetes or some similar system, you can make use of the health check endpoint. This is a regular REST route (note: _not_ GraphQL), available at `/health`.

```text 
REQUEST: GET http://localhost:3000/health
```
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "info": {
    "database": {
      "status": "up"
    },
    "worker": {
      "status": "up"
    }
  },
  "error": {},
  "details": {
    "database": {
      "status": "up"
    },
    "worker": {
      "status": "up"
    }
  }
}
```

Health checks are built on the [Nestjs Terminus module](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus). You can also add your own health checks by creating plugins that make use of the [HealthCheckRegistryService]({{< relref "health-check-registry-service" >}}).

## Admin UI

If you have customized the Admin UI with extensions, it can make sense to [compile your extensions ahead-of-time as part of the deployment process]({{< relref "/docs/plugins/extending-the-admin-ui" >}}#compiling-as-a-deployment-step).
