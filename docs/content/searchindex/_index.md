# search index

The content of this file is not actually used - it is just a placeholder so that Hugo will generate a file named `searchindex/`.

The contents of this file are actually generated by the [searchindex.html](../../layouts/searchindex/searchindex.html) template, which loops over all the content and extracts the title, heading and url data into a JSON data structure which can be loaded async by the [SearchWidget class](../../assets/scripts/search-widget.ts).
