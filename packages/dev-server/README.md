# Vendure Dev Server

This package is not published to npm. It is used in development of the Vendure server and plugins.

### Running

To run the server, run the `start` script.

### Populating data

Test data can be populated by running the `populate` script. This uses the same sample data as is used by the Vendure CLI when running `init`, albeit with the additional step of populating some sample customer & address data too.
